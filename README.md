# Expo Camera `takePictureAsync` Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API: calling `takePictureAsync` before the camera is fully initialized.  This leads to an error because the camera might still be loading.

## Problem

The issue arises from accessing the camera's functionality before it's completely ready.  The `takePictureAsync` function throws an error if called prematurely.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the camera is ready before attempting to use `takePictureAsync`.  This is typically achieved by checking the camera's status or using asynchronous operations to wait for initialization completion.
